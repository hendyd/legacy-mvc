# Joomla Legacy MVC plugin
Joomla 4.0 removed what was known as the "new" MVC classes from the system. If you still need those for your component, you can install this plugin to get those back. Simply install and enable this plugin to have them autoloaded. Please still plan on migrating away from these classes to the current MVC classes used in Joomla.
